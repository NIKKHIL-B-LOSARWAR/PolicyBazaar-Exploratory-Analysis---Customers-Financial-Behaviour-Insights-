## **Project Summary** 

- The project aimed to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the PolicyBazaar dataset to optimize financial product recommendations by gaining a deep understanding of the customer base. 
- The development process was shaped by the analysis scope defined by the dataset's attributes and relevant business matrices. We focused on four key areas:

  - Area 1 : Customers' monthly finances analysis
  - Area 2 : Credit behavior analysis
  - Area 3 : Debt and loans analysis
  - Area 4 : Investment behavior analysis
For each area, we defined relevant business questions to assess PolicyBazaar's business scenario. 
- In summary, the EDA process involved data import, cleaning, transformation, exploration, wrangling, visualization, interpretation, and generating key insights.
